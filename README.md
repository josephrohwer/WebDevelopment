# Planet Tracker
## What is Planet Tracker?
Planet Tracker is a web application that acts as a content management system for planets and their related planetary data. Depending on the user's access level, the application serves a variety of different functions. A user without an account visiting the page can search for planets and view details about various planets in the system. They also have the option to create an account and sign in so they can add planets themselves. An admin user has the most permissions, with the ability to add, edit, and delete planets. The admin user also has access to a special "Admin" page where they can create new users and delete existing ones.
